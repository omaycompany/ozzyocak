                            <strong>0 - creating and selling magazines</strong><br>
                            when i was 6 years old my dad bought me a computer and a printer. we also had some comedy
                            books
                            in the house. so i created a maagazine with small comedy stories and sold them to my uncles
                            etc.
                        </p>

                            <strong>1- small cafe in a market</strong><br>
                            i worked every weekend every available time i could find while i was in high school. i was
                            working in market as a cashier. after many years of people asking for "pogaca" (only balkan
                            people will understand) and i'm saying no. i rented a small place in the market then bought
                            some
                            tables and a "pogaca" fridge. it wasnt a good idea!

                            <strong>2- car vacuum vending machine</strong><br>
                            again high school. i bought a vacuum vending machine, rented a space in a gas station, put
                            it
                            there, machine was simple you put 1 euro(tl) it worked 5 minutes. this machine provided me
                            all
                            the money i needed when i was in high school. however later my lease ended and i stopped. it
                            was
                            a good idea.

                            when i started college i was importing car wash and detailing stuff from the us. i was
                            selling
                            them online and via wholesale by going door to door. it didnt take off.

                            <strong>4 - carnavale</strong><br>
                            in my sophomore year , i tried to start a car sharing, rent by minute platform in ankara
                            ,the
                            capital of turkiye, which later failed due to lack of will because i was studying at the
                            time.
                            but when i was creating this brand i had to explain this novel idea to lot of people via
                            video i
                            made by working with illustration artists. this gave me the idea of selling explainer
                            animations
                            to companies to explain their concepts like i was.

                            <strong>5- işkutusu</strong><br>
                            animation production company, this was the first business that took of (a bit). i was
                            selling
                            animations to startups, small companies etc. later i rented a garage in istinye. i turned
                            this
                            garage into a very cool studio. this business later became part of olo medya.

                            <strong>6- işbitirici.com</strong><br>
                            online therapy site, which i started in 2014. we made the platform , used webrtc technology
                            to
                            conduct online sessions via psychotherapists. we had few sessions, the business could work
                            greatly, however i was 22 and lacked some perseverence i guess, somehow we stopped doing it.
                            also because i was making money on my other business, i thought i should be focusing on it.
                            id
                            didnt take off.

                            <strong>7- olo medya</strong><br>
                            işkutusu grew so we had to start an actual llc company. olo medya had 2 main arms, one was
                            the
                            animatiın business the other one was an advertising technology. this was the first "real"
                            business i created. i had employees, accounting, entreprise clients etc. i was 22 at the
                            time .
                            first aour explainer videos got attention and we made deals with film producers, for
                            animation
                            tv series. i created 2 tv series at the time with a team around 5 people, i directed and
                            personally edited around 100 animation videos in 2 years. olo medya s second arm was the
                            technology business. after google chrome stopped supporting adobe flash some of the online
                            advertisers had a problem of counting the impressions and clicks on their ads. so i found a
                            guy
                            in greece who is an expert of video players, bought the tech for $20/month and sold this
                            technology as a service to many big online publishers and brands.
                            <br><br>
                            when i was 23 at some point i was making around $150.000 arr which was an incredible amount
                            for
                            a junior college student in istanbul. i froze my college to handle the business operations
                            for 2
                            years. the business somehow lost traction but still doing okay. however around that time my
                            father offered me a job, he told me to come help him manage his company, which was a
                            $250.000.000 arr company. i said yes beacuse i wanted to do big numbers, like every most 23
                            year
                            olds. i closed my home and my company and moved back to ankara. 15 days later i got fired
                            from
                            family home and business. within few weeks i lost everything. it was hard on me so i lived
                            in
                            some village home alone for 6 months to get my shid back together and i did.

                            <strong>8- omay grup</strong><br>
                            when i was 21 i started omay but didnt actually pursue it, i sold few websites thats all.
                            when i
                            finished college i decided to rebuild this business, so i was selling websites that are
                            built on
                            different cms platforms like wordpress etc. i also started managing some ads, and some
                            creative
                            work bla bla and this turned into a digital agency. i hired some people rented an office and
                            did
                            some hard work until covid. after covid the business boomed a bit. i gave service to more
                            than
                            50 clients in many countries. all sorts of digital consulting but mainly it was b2b
                            marketing.
                            to this day omay is still active.

                            <strong>9- omay textile</strong><br>
                            29 years old, i got married. my father in law and i became friends. we walked 10 kms every
                            weekend and had these long business talks . he owned a sizeable fabric factory. he saw what
                            i
                            was doing with digital marketing and he kind of persuaded me into selling fabrics in bulk.
                            from
                            my previous experiences i wasnt so keen to close my company once again, so i bootstrapped
                            (did
                            this as side business) a textile business, producing and selling fabrics in bulk. but i
                            didnt
                            wanted to business with family so i built my own thing. the business was basically this, i
                            was
                            showing samples to the clients. they were ordering bigger samples like 100 kgs. i was
                            producing
                            that too. then if they like the product they will place orders like 2-10 thousand kilograms
                            of
                            fabric. i found few outsource fabric producers in southeastern turkey. visited them couple
                            times, built good relations, went to their homes, weddings etc. everything was great. sales
                            was
                            booming i was en route to 7 figures arr. i was selling fabrics to the biggest brands in my
                            country. the fabrics we did were great, durable, cheap etc. however one day in february i
                            woke
                            up and saw in the news that southeastern turkiye hit by an enormous disaster. the factories
                            i
                            worked with was out of reach. many dead. of course these people were my friends and
                            acquaintances so it was devastating for me and for my business. i had to cancel many orders,
                            at
                            that time i just opened a 3 story building one level for r&d , one was a showroom, and the
                            other
                            one was our offices. we invested some amount. also we did a lot of investement to r&d .
                            because
                            the factories were offlibe i had to work with lower level producers, which cost us our
                            bigger
                            clients. also it was operational hell, i had to deal with a lot of different purchasing and
                            logistics without any experience and knowledge. many scammers are operating, and a lot of
                            practices that look like normal activity but scam in this line of business. after a while
                            business losses became unbearable. this was the worst business i have ever done. i stopped
                            doing
                            this. closed everything, sold every stock left. took and oath to not do physical business
                            again.
                            one positive note, i know tons about yarns, fabrics an clothing. i design and produce most
                            of my
                            own clothes(not by hand via producers)
                        </p>

                            <strong>10- expandia</strong><br>
                            after i closed textile, i moved to switzerland for an unplanned duration. i was financially
                            and
                            mentally wrecked by the textile business. i decided to rebrand, rebuild my agency. omay had
                            very
                            nice clients in switzerland and it was very nice to work with them. also i speak french,
                            that
                            directed me as well. i turned omay into expandia, built expandia as a b2b marketing/revops
                            brand. later my clients were demanding more services, so we added cybersecurity and some
                            operational services. expandia is still active. its not an incredible business but it makes
                            the
                            soup, and i enjoy doing it. this business helps me to fund the next company which im
                            building
                            right now.

                            <strong>11- buffsend</strong><br>
                            cold outreach saas. i developed buffsend to scratch my own itch. i was paying a lot of money
                            on
                            hubspot, apollo, lemlist etc . i realized i can code this myself. so i created buffsend. at
                            first it was kind of an internal tool, but i couldnt hold myself and turned it into a saas
                            product. you can send sequential emails, call, do basic crm stuff with buffsend. but i dont
                            want
                            to continue this project as is. its not my best work and there are lot of competitors and a
                            limited market. so i dont want to bother much. but i will turn it to sometihng that will
                            work in
                            a bigger market when i have the time.
